# Linear-Regression
<br>
- To perform linear regression on the given data, and train the model for prediction. After training, evaluate the model with MAE, MSE, and RMSE. 
- The data contains scores obtained by 25 students in an exam, along with the number of hours spent studying.

## Pearson correlation coefficient

- The correlation coefficient between the number of hours spent studying and the scores obtained is 0.976191 . 
- This indicates a strong linear relationship between the two variables, suggesting that as the number of hours spent studying increases, the scores tend to increase as well.
